## Course description

This introductory course is designed for students who desire a strong grounding in statistical concepts, and has a greater degree of mathematical rigor than STAT UN1101. Topics include: graphical and numerical summaries of data; the normal distribution, probability, random variables, and sampling distributions; estimation and hypothesis testing for means and proportions; comparing two populations; two-way contingency tables; introduction to linear regression. This course serves as the pre-requisite for ECON UN3412.

## Resources and readings

### Required text:

Devore, Jay L. 2016. Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences. 9<sup>th</sup> edition. <ISBN:9781305251809>

You need the **9th edition** for the exercises; you can use earlier editions for the content.

### Recommended text:

Gonick, Larry & Woollcott Smith. 2005. The Cartoon Guide to Statistics. <ISBN:9780062731029>

### Other materials:

For the tests and final, you need a **non-graphing** calculator (one line display). Statistical tables will be provided.

## Grading procedures

Grades will be determined as follows:

<table>
<tr><td>Homework + class problem</td><td>20%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test #1</td><td>20%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test #2</td><td>20%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final</td><td>40%</td></tr>
</table>


Grading scale: 

(Note: Do not rely on any averages that appear in CourseWorks since they may not be accurate for various reasons.)
</p>
<table width = "800">
<tr><td>97% + </td><td>A+</td><td>  </td><td>80% to 83%</td><td>B-</td></tr>
<tr><td>93% to 97%</td><td>A</td><td>  </td><td>75% to 80%</td><td>C+</td></tr>
<tr><td>90% to 93%</td><td>A-</td><td>  </td><td>70% to 75%</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>87% to 90%</td><td>B+</td><td>  </td><td>60% to 70%</td><td>C-</td></tr>
<tr><td>83% to 86%</td><td>B</td><td>  </td><td>below 60%</td><td>F</td></tr>
</table>

Note: The tests and final exam are curved on an individual basis, meaning one test may have a curve while another does not. The grades posted on CourseWorks are the grades AFTER the curve.  There is no additional curve in the process of computing final averages at the end of the semester. Raw scores are available on the paper tests which will be handed back in class. If you are not in class when tests are handed back, you may pick up your exam the following class.

## Class policies

**Cell phones are NOT allowed in class.**

## Homework

Unless otherwise indicated, assignments must be submitted on CourseWorks as a <strong>single pdf file</strong> -- TurboScan or similar phone apps can be used for this purpose.

Homework must be submitted by 11:59pm on the due date for full credit. Late assignments will only be accepted for the first 24 hours after the assignment is due. You are entitled to one "free" late assignment, submitted within 24 hours of the due date, without penalty. After that, 4 points will be deducted for late assignments submitted within 24 hours of the due date. After the 24 hour period, you will receive a zero for the assignment. No exceptions will be made unless I receive a note from an academic dean detailing unusual circumstances.

If you submit more than one assignment, the last one will be counted.

Be sure that homework is clearly labeled and legible.

Note that not all homework questions are graded so be sure to check all of your work against the posted solutions. (In short, a 20/20 doesn't necessarily mean that everything is right.)

## R

All of the coding related parts of the class are optional and will not appear on the tests. 

## Academic Integrity

You are encouraged to discuss homework strategies with your classmates and work through examples, but you may not discuss particular homework problems, nor copy all or part of solutions from anywhere. In short, the homework you submit must be your own work.

Plagiarism or any other breach of academic integrity will not be tolerated and will result in disciplinary action. For more information please refer to the The Columbia University Undergraduate Guide to Academic Integrity:

<http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/academicintegrity>

## Tests

Allowable materials on tests include pens, pencils, erasers, a hand-held NON-GRAPHING calculator (one line display), and a single (two-sided, or two one-sided) 8.5” x 11” sheet of original handwritten notes for the first two tests, and three sheets (each two-sided, or six one-sided) for the final. Make-up tests will only be administered in cases of documented emergencies.

All tests are cumulative but weighted more toward new material.

As soon as test dates are available, they will be posted as CourseWorks Assignments.

For the date of the Final, see https://ssol.columbia.edu/ -- click "Exam List" and then "Projected University Examination Schedule". (In most cases, final dates are set by the University not individual professors.)

## Getting Help

There are numerous opportunities to get assistance with the class material:

<ol>
<li>Ask questions during class.</li>
<li>Email me questions after class and I will answer during the next lecture.</li>
<li>Ask questions after class (I will stay after every class if students have questions.)</li>
<li>Attend a Statistics Help Room session where tutors answer questions for students in introductory level statistics classes. I will announce when the Help Room opens for the semester; generally the 2nd or 3rd week of classes.  Hours and locations are posted here:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://stat.columbia.edu/help-room/">http://stat.columbia.edu/help-room/</a></li> (Once the Help Room opens, the page will be updated to the current semester.)
<li>Attend TA office hours: see above for times and locations</li>
</ol>
