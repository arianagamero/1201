R Resources to accompany Devore, *Probability and Statistics*, 9th edition

Note: These code examples are not meant to represent the shortest and most elegant way to code in R. Rather, the goal is to reduce the tedium of certain calculations while retaining the focus on understanding that comes with studying formulas and performing calculations by hand.

## Chapter 1

[Stem and leaf plot](StemandLeafPlot.md)

[Frequency histogram](FrequencyHistogram.md)

[Density histogram](DensityHistogram.md)

[Boxplot](Boxplot.md)

Note that each file name has two extensions: .R and .md; the .R file is better for downloading the source code (control click on the file name) while the .md is better for viewing the output/plots on line (click the file name).

Commonly used parameters:

`las = 1`:   all axis text horizontal
