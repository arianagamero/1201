## Factorial (2.3)

```{r}
factorial(5)
```

## Combinations (2.3)

"5 choose 2" = choose 2 items out of 5

```{r}
choose(5, 2)
```

## Permutations (2.3)

There is no built-in function to calculate permutations.  You can multiply the number of combinations by *k!*.

Ex. Number of permutations of size 2 that can be formed from 5 distinct items:

```{r}
choose(5,2)*factorial(2)
```

You can create your own function to do this:
```{r}
perm <- function(n, k) {choose(n,k)*factorial(k)}

perm(5,2)
```
