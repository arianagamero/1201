# Statistical Intervals Based on a Single Sample {#chap7}

Devore, Chapter 7

Sections covered: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3

## Basic Properties of Confidence Intervals (7.1) {-}

Skip: "Deriving a Confidence Interval", pp. 282-284; "Bootstrap Confidence Intervals", p. 284

## Large-Sample Confidence Intervals for a Population Mean and Proportion (7.2) {-}

You may use: $\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n}}$, rather than the formula (7.10) in the blue box on p. 289 for large sample confidence intervals for proportions, skip p. 290

You may use the method from class $n = \frac{4z^2\hat{p}\hat{q}}{w^2}$ for the minimum $n$ needed to ensure a particular confidence interval width for proportions, rather than formula (7.12) -- both appear on p. 291. As noted in Example 7.9 on p. 291, the easier formula gives a slightly different answer (385 instead of 381).

## Intervals Based on a Normal Population Distribution (7.3) {-}
