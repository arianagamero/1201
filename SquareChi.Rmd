## R {-}

The `chisq.test()` function requires that data be in matrix form:

```{r}
# p. 647, #28
mat <- matrix(c(28, 17, 7, 31, 26, 10, 26, 19, 11), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

dimnames(mat) <- list(`Email_Provider` = c("gmail", "Yahoo", "Other"),
                      `Cell_Phone_Provider` = c("ATT", "Verizon", "Other"))

chisq.test(mat, correct = FALSE)

```

To see the expected values:

```{r}
results <- chisq.test(mat, correct = FALSE)
round(results$expected, 2)
```

Mosaic plot


```{r}
mosaicplot(t(mat), color = c("aliceblue", "cornflowerblue", "navyblue"), main = "")
```
