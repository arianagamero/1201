## 9.1 $z$ Tests and CI's for a Difference Between Two Population Means {-}

(Cases 1 & 2)

Skip: $\beta$ and the Choice of Sample Size (pp. 366-367)

### R {-}

Since you aren't given the original data, R isn't very helpful here, but you can write a function that you could reuse, such as:

```{r}
options(scipen = 999) # get rid of scientific notation

# this function only has to be run once per session, and then you can reuse it.

diffmeans <- function(xbar, ybar, delta0,
                      sigma1, sigma2,
                      m, n, type = "twosided") {
  
Z <- ((xbar - ybar) - delta0)/sqrt(((sigma1^2)/m) + ((sigma2^2)/n))


if (type == "twosided") {
  pvalue <- pnorm(-abs(Z))*2
} else if (type == "lowertail") {
  pvalue <- pnorm(Z)
} else {
  pvalue <- 1 - pnorm(Z)
}

print(c("The p-value is", round(pvalue, 4)))

}


# Example 9.1, p. 365

diffmeans(xbar  = 29.8, ybar  = 34.7,
          delta0 = 0, sigma1 = 4, sigma2 = 5,
          m = 20, n = 25, type = "twosided")

# Example 9.4, p. 368

# As long as you use the correct order of parameters, you don't have to write out the names:

diffmeans(2258, 2637, -200, 1519, 1138, 663, 413, "lowertail")
```
